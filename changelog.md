> [!Important]
> ### This is a beta release
> Consider using the stable version unless you specifically want to test new features.
> The `.msi` installer is not fully compressed, hence the large file size. This is expected for a beta release.
> This release will not receive automatic updates. If a newer beta version becomes available you will need to install it manually.

## Changelog
- Major refactor of all components
  - Main concern here is making sure `card farming` and `achievement unlocker` function as intended as these are the hardest things to test on my own
- Some backend improvements to speed things up
- Miscellaneous UI changes and improvements
