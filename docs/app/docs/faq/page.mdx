## General

<details id='Why are some games not showing up in my games list in SGI?'>
    <summary>Why are some games not showing up in my games list in SGI?</summary>
    > There are several reasons why a game may not appear in your SGI games list:
    > * Family shared games don't appear in the games list by default, but you can add them to any of the lists *(Card Farming, Achievement Unlocker, etc..)*  by using the `+` button, entering the game's AppID and name, and clicking "Add"
    > * The game may be [marked as private](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1150-C06F-4D62-4966) on your Steam profile
    > * Some demos and playtests may not show up correctly in SGI, or be able to be idled
    > * The game may have been removed from the Steam store or your license for the game may have been revoked
</details>

<details id='Do I need to make my Steam profile and game details public for the Steam card idler to work?'>
    <summary>Do I need to make my Steam profile and game details public for the Steam card idler to work?</summary>
    > In most cases, yes. For some features to function correctly SGI requires your Steam profile and game details to be set to public in your [privacy settings](https://steamcommunity.com/id/undefined/edit/settings).
    >
    > However, providing your own Steam Web API key in the [settings > general](/docs/settings/general) will allow you to use SGI with a private profile.

<details id='What makes this different from other Steam tools?'>
    <summary>What makes this different from other Steam tools?</summary>
    > SGI combines multiple useful features from a range of other tools, while other tools may focus on a single aspect. SGI offers card farming, achievement management, trading card management, and playtime boosting in a single, user-friendly interface.
</details>

<details id='Do I need an internet connection to use SGI?'>
    <summary>Do I need an internet connection to use SGI?</summary>

<details id='What is the "Do you want to allow public/private networks to access this app" message when I first launched SGI?'>
    <summary>What is the "Do you want to allow public/private networks to access this app" message when I first launched SGI?</summary>

    >
    > If you declined the prompt already, you will need to add SGI as an allowed app in Windows Defender Firewall:
    >
    > 1. Open the Windows Control Panel
    > 2. Go to System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall
    > 3. Click on "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
    > 4. Click "Change settings" then "Add another app..." and then "Browse"
    > 5. Navigate to the install directory of the app you want to add, select it, and click "Open"
    > 6. Check the boxes for "Private" and/or "Public" networks as needed
    > 7. Click "OK" to save the changes
