# FAQ

## General

<details>
    <summary>Can I get banned for using a Steam idler?</summary>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>Do I need to make my Steam profile and game details public for the Steam card idler to work?</summary>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>What makes this different from other Steam idlers?</summary>

</details>

<details>
    <summary>What is the "Do you want to allow public/private networks to access this app" message when I first launched SGI?</summary>
    > SGI needs to handle multiple inbound/outbound HTTP requests to fetch data from Steam. For SGI to function correctly you will need to accept this prompt
    >
    > If you declined the prompt already, you will need to add SGI as an allowed app in Windows Defender Firewall:
    >
    > 1. Open the Windows Control Panel
    > 2. Go to System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall
    > 3. Click on "Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall"
    > 4. Click "Change settings" then "Add another app..." and then "Browse"
    > 5. Navigate to the install directory of the app you want to add, select it, and click "Open"
    > 6. Check the boxes for "Private" and/or "Public" networks as needed
    > 7. Click "OK" to save the changes

## Farming cards

<details>
    <summary>What are trading cards and how do they work with Steam idlers?</summary>
    > This is covered in great detail in [Steam's Trading Cards FAQ](https://steamcommunity.com/tradingcards/faq). Our Steam trading card idler automates the process of collecting these cards through Steam idle functionality.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why am I not getting any card drops with the Steam card idler?</summary>
    > * You can only receive a limited amount of card drops per game, check "How do I know if my games have card drops remaining?" below for more information
    > * New accounts, accounts with recently refunded games, or accounts with [other restrictions](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A) might experience a delay of up to 3 hours before receiving their first card drop, or even no card drops at all
    > * You must be connected to the internet and signed in to the Steam client
    > * Free-to-play (F2P) games typically require in-game purchases to drop cards
    > * You need to own the game on your account. It can't be a family-shared game
    > * Games must not be [marked as private](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1150-C06F-4D62-4966)
    > * Paid games earned from promotions typically won't drop cards
</details>

    > 2. Click on `Badges`
    > 3. Scroll down, or press `CTRL+F` to search for the game's title
    > 4. In the top-right of the game card, you will see either `X card drops remaining` or `no card drops remaining`
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How long does it take for cards to drop?</summary>
    > Card drop timers can be different for every game. The developer sets them and they can vary from 15 minutes to 1 hour
</details>

## Steam idling (auto & manual)

<details>
    <summary>Can I use the Steam idler to idle in-game items?</summary>
    > No. SGI cannot idle in-game items as it doesn't run an instance of the game. A feature like this could also be seen as exploiting in most game's ToS
</details>

<details>
    <summary>How many games can the Steam idler handle simultaneously?</summary>
    > You can idle a max of 32 games simultaneously with our Steam idling technology. This is the same limit used when farming cards
</details>

## Unlocking & locking achievements (auto & manual)

<details>
    <summary>Why can't I unlock achievements for a specific game?</summary>
    > While most achievements for most games can be unlocked with SGI, some can't be. Some games contain `protected` achievements and statistics that can only be modified by official game servers. [Learn more](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/achievements#game_server_stats:~:text=Stats%20and%20achievements%20that%20are%20settable%20by%20game%20servers%20cannot%20be%20set%20by%20clients.)
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why do I see "No achievements found" and "No statistics found" on the game's achievement manager screen?</summary>
    > * The game you are trying to view achievements for does not have any achievements
    > * Your 'Game Details' are set to private in your Steam profile settings
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Will unlocking achievements affect my completion percentage on tracking sites?</summary>
    > Yes, achievements unlocked with SGI will count toward your completion percentage on sites like Steam, TrueSteamAchievements, SteamHunters, and others that track Steam achievements.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I unlock achievements for games I don't own?</summary>
    > No, you can only unlock achievements for games that are owned by your Steam account. The game must be in your library.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Is there a way to unlock achievements in a specific order?</summary>
    > Currently, SGI unlocks achievements randomly within your configured time range. There's no built-in way to specify a custom order, but you can manually unlock specific achievements using the Achievement Manager.
</details>

## Performance & System

<details>
    <summary>How much system resources does SGI use?</summary>
    > SGI is lightweight and uses minimal system resources. The main application typically uses less than 100MB of RAM. When idling games, external SteamUtility processes are created, each using around 10-20MB of RAM and minimal CPU.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Can I run multiple instances of SGI?</summary>
    > Yes, you can run multiple instances of SGI to manage different Steam accounts or to unlock achievements for multiple games simultaneously. Each instance must be configured for a different Steam account.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Does SGI work with Steam family sharing?</summary>
    > SGI works with your own games, but has limitations with family-shared games. You cannot idle or manage achievements for games that are shared with you from another account. You can only manage games you own directly.
</details>

<details>
    <summary>Why does SGI create SteamUtility.exe processes?</summary>
    > SteamUtility.exe processes are created to communicate with Steam and simulate game activity. These are external helper processes that are automatically managed by SGI - they start when needed and close when games stop being idled.
</details>
