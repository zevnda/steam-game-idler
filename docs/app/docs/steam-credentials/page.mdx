# Steam Credentials

SGI needs your Steam community credentials for the account you want to farm trading cards on. This allows it to determine which games still have card drops available. Without these credentials, SGI can't verify card drop status.

<Callout type='error'>
    Do not share these credentials with anyone
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
    You can skip these steps if you do not plan to use the [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming) feature

    You must get your cookies from https://steamcommunity.com/ and not https://store.steam.com/
