# Introduction

Steam Game Idler (SGI) is a simple, user-friendly tool designed to help you farm trading cards, manage achievements, and boost playtime across all games in your Steam library.

This project was born out of frustration with alternatives like SAM and ASF, which often lacked key features, were overly complex to set up, had ugly outdated interfaces, or suffered from bugs and infrequent updates.

SGI combines the best aspects of these tools into a single, modern, free, and easy-to-use application.
