#### Price Adjustment
Add or subtract a fixed amount from the sale price of all trading cards listed for sale. This can be useful to adjust prices based on market trends or personal preferences.

#### Sell Limit Blacklist
Set minimum and maximum price limits for selling trading cards. If the final sale price is below the minimum or above the maximum, the card will not be listed for sale. This helps avoid selling cards at unfavorable prices.
