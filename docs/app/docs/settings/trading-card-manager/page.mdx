# Trading Card Manager

#### Default Sell Option
Choose the default sell price for trading cards when using the `sell all` button

Prices are fetched from the item's Steam market listing page. For example, [this trading card's listing page](https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/774861-Traitor) has it's own [price histogram data](https://steamcommunity.com/market/itemordershistogram?country=AU&language=english&currency=21&item_nameid=176219335). The histogram data is the same data that populates the tables on the card's listing page

The histogram data contains a `highest_buy_order` and `lowest_sell_order` price, which are used to determine the default sell price

#### Price Adjustment
Add or subtract a fixed amount from the sale price of all trading cards listed for sale. This can be useful to adjust prices based on market trends or personal preferences

For example, if you set a price adjustment of `-0.10`, and sell a card listed at `1.00`, it will be sold for `0.90`

#### Sell Limit
Set minimum and maximum price limits for selling trading cards

If the final sale price is below the minimum or above the maximum, the card will not be listed for sale. This helps avoid selling cards at unfavorable prices

For example, if you set a minimum price of `0.50` and a maximum price of `2.00`, cards priced below `0.50` or above `2.00` will not be sold

#### Sell Delay

Set a delay between listing each trading card for sale to avoid being rate-limited by Steam's API
