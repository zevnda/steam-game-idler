# General

#### Always Online
Prevents Steam from setting your status as away while SGI is running

If you have this enabled, you will not be able to set your status to away or offline in Steam while SGI is running as SGI will always set your status back to online

#### Free Game Notifications
Get native Windows notifications when free Steam games are available to add to your account

SGI will exclude games that you already own, but you will need to make sure your games list data in SGI is up to date by click the `Refresh` button in `Your Games`

#### Beta Features
Enable beta features that are not yet available in the stable version of SGI

Beta features may be unstable, change unexpectedly, or be removed at any time. If you experience any issues when using a beta feature, please report it on GitHub

#### Disable Tooltips
Disable non-essential tooltips in the app

Tooltips are small pop-up messages that pop up when you hover over certain elements in the app. They provide additional information about the element, but can be distracting for some users

#### Run At Startup
Automatically launch SGI when Windows starts by adding it to your startup programs

This allows you to have SGI running in the background without needing to manually start it each time you log in to Windows

#### Start Minimized
Start SGI minimized to the system tray instead of showing the main window on startup. The app will remain hidden until manually opened via the system tray icon

#### Language
Choose the language you want SGI to be displayed in. The language should be set automatically based on your system language, but you can change it to any of the supported languages

#### Currency
Choose the currency you want to use when displaying prices for in features such as [Trading Card Manager](/docs/features/trading-card-manager)

This currency will also be used to determine the sell price for trading cards

#### Steam Credentials

SGI needs your Steam community credentials for the account you want to farm trading cards on. This allows it to determine which games still have card drops available. Check the [Steam Credentials](/docs/steam-credentials) section for more information

#### Steam Web API Key
Allows users to provide their own Steam Web API key to fetch profile and game data. API keys are free for all users with a Steam account, you can [get yours here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
  - Useful if users want to keep their Steam profile and game details set to private
  - The API key must belong to the same account you're logged into in SGI. If using multiple accounts, you must set the API key for each account separately
  - Some features may still be limited with private profiles
