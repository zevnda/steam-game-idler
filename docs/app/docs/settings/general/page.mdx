# General

#### Prevent away status on Steam
Keeps your Steam status set to `online` while SGI is running, preventing it from automatically switching to `away` due to inactivity

#### Get notifications about free games
Receive native Windows notifications when free Steam games are available to add to your account

#### Enable beta feature
Enable beta features that are not yet available in the stable version of SGI. These features are still in development, they may not work as expected or cause crashes

#### Disable tooltips
Disable non-important tooltips that appear when you hover over certain UI elements

#### Run at startup
Automatically launch SGI when Windows starts by adding it to your startup programs

#### Start minimized
Start SGI minimized to the system tray instead of showing the main window on startup. The app will remain hidden until manually opened from the system tray

#### Language
Choose the language you want SGI to be displayed in. The language is set automatically based on your system language, but you can change it to any of the supported languages

#### Theme
Choose between light, dark and other preset themes for SGI

#### Currency
Choose the currency you want to use when displaying prices for in features such as Trading Card Manager

#### Steam Web API Key
Lets users provide their own Steam Web API key to fetch profile and game data. API keys are free for all users with a Steam account, you can [get yours here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
  - Useful if users want to keep their Steam profile and game details set to private
  - The API key must belong to the same account you're logged into in SGI. If using multiple accounts, you must set the API key for each account separately
  - Some features may still be limited with private profiles
