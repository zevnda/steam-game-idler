# Achievement Unlocker

#### Idle games while Achievement Unlocker is active

Idles the current game while [Achievement Unlocker](/docs/features/achievement-unlocker) is running, until all achievements are unlocked or the process is manually stopped

#### Skip hidden achievements

Achievements that are listed as `hidden` by the game developer will be skipped

#### Run next task automatically

Automatically start the selected feature when Achievement Unlocker finishes

#### Only unlock achievements between X and Y

Choose a time range for when SGI should unlock achievements. When outside of your scheduled time range, [Achievement Unlocker](/docs/features/achievement-unlocker) will continue to run, but it will not unlock achievements. It will begin unlocking achievements again when back inside the scheduled time range

#### Unlock achievements randomly every X minutes

This will determine how often SGI will unlock a new achievement _(in minutes)_.

After unlocking an achievement, SGI starts a countdown using a random time within your specified range. For example, with a range of `60 to 180 minutes`, SGI selects a random waiting period between 1-3 hours before unlocking the next achievement and starting a new countdown.
