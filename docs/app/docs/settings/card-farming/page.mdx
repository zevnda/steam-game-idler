# Card Farming

#### Farm Games In List
SGI will only idle games you've manually added to your Card Farming list, ignoring all others

#### Farm All Games
SGI will automatically idle all games in your library that still have trading card drops available

You can manually view which games in your Steam library have card drops remaining by going to [Steam Profile â†’ Badges](https://steamcommunity.com/my/badges/)

#### Schedule Next Task
Automatically start the selected feature when Card Farming finishes

For example, if you select "Achievement Unlocker", it will automatically start the Achievement Unlocker feature after Card Farming finishes
