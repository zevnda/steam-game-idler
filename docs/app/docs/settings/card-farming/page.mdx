# Card Farming

## Options

### Farm cards for games in the Card Farming list
* **Purpose:** SGI will only idle games you've manually added to your Card Farming list, ignoring all others

### Farm cards for all games with card drops remaining

* **Purpose:** SGI will automatically idle all games in your library that still have trading card drops available

## Steam credentials

* **Purpose:** SGI needs your Steam community credentials for the account you want to farm trading cards on. This allows it to determine which games still have card drops available. Check the [Steam Credentials](/docs/steam-credentials) section for more information
