# Card Farming

#### Farm cards for games in the Card Farming list
SGI will only idle games you've manually added to your Card Farming list, ignoring all others

#### Farm cards for all games with card drops remaining

SGI will automatically idle all games in your library that still have trading card drops available

#### Run next task automatically

Automatically start the selected feature when Card Farming finishes

#### Steam credentials

SGI needs your Steam community credentials for the account you want to farm trading cards on. This allows it to determine which games still have card drops available. Check the [Steam Credentials](/docs/steam-credentials) section for more information
