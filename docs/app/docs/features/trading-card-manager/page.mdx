# Trading Card Manager

The Trading Card Manager feature allows you to manage your Steam trading card inventory directly within SGI, including the ability to view your card collection and sell cards on the Steam marketplace.

</Steps>

## Additional Information

You can click <MockButton type='remove-all'/> to remove all of your active trading card listings from the Steam marketplace

SGI accounts for the 15% Steam marketplace fee when you set a sale price. For example, if you set a sale price of `$0.50` SGI will actually list the card for `$0.44`

Setting a price greater than `$0.00` will automatically select that card for sale, or you can manually select and deselect cards using the checkbox for each card

Not all cards have `lowest price` and `median price` data available. I believe market price data is only available if the card has been sold on the Steam marketplace in the last 30 days

When you sell or earn trading cards you will need to manually refresh the Trading Card Manager list to see the changes. You can do this by clicking the <Icon type='refresh' /> button in the page header
