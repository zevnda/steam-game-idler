## Additional Information

- Click <MockButton type='remove-all'/> to remove all your active trading card listings from the Steam marketplace.
- When you use <MockButton type='sell-all' />, SGI will list each card at the `highest_buy_order`. If that price isn't available, it will use the `lowest_sell_order`. If neither price is available, the card won't be listed. You can change the default sell option in [Settings → Trading Card Manager](/docs/settings/trading-card-manager).
- SGI gets card prices from the Steam marketplace `https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/{market_hash_name}` and its histogram data `https://steamcommunity.com/market/itemordershistogram?country={country}&language={language}&currency={currency}&item_nameid={item_nameid}.`
- To see a card's price details, click the `show market prices` button at the bottom of the card.
- SGI automatically subtracts the 15% Steam marketplace fee when you set a sale price. For example, if you set a price of `$0.50`, SGI will list the card for `$0.44`.
- Setting a price above `$0.00` will automatically select that card for sale. You can also select or deselect cards using the checkbox next to each card.
- After you sell or earn trading cards, click <MockButton type='refresh' /> in the page header to update your card list.
