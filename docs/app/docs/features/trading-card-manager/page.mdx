# Trading Card Manager

## Additional Information

Cards sold via the <MockButton type='sell-all' /> option will be listed at the `highest_buy_order` price if available, or the `lowest_sell_order` price if not. If neither is available, the card will not be sold. You can change which option you would prefer to use by default in [Settings → Trading Card Manager](/docs/settings/trading-card-manager).

The price data for trading cards is sourced from the item's Steam marketplace page `https://steamcommunity.com/market/listings/753/{market_hash_name}` and its histogram data `https://steamcommunity.com/market/itemordershistogram?country={country}&language={language}&currency={currency}&item_nameid={item_nameid}`.

You can view a card's price data by clicking the `show market prices` button at the bottom of the card.

You can click <MockButton type='remove-all'/> to remove all of your active trading card listings from the Steam marketplace

SGI accounts for the 15% Steam marketplace fee when you set a sale price. For example, if you set a sale price of `$0.50` SGI will actually list the card for `$0.44`

Setting a price greater than `$0.00` will automatically select that card for sale, or you can manually select and deselect cards using the checkbox for each card

When you sell or earn trading cards you will need to manually refresh the Trading Card Manager list to see the changes. You can do this by clicking the <Icon type='refresh' /> button in the page header
