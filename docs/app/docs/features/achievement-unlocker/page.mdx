## Additional Information

You can add as many games to your `achievement unlocker list` as you like, but to remain looking legitimate, SGI will only unlock achievements for one game at a time. Once all achievements for that game have been unlocked, SGI will move on to the next game in the list.

You can run multiple instances of SGI to unlock achievements for multiple games simultaneously. You will need to pick which games to unlock achievements for in each instance.
