# Achievement Unlocker

The Steam Achievement Unlocker feature will automatically unlock your Steam game's achievements in a way that looks like they were earned naturally.

<Callout type="info">
    Configure the features settings in [Settings → Achievement Unlocker](/docs/settings/achievement-unlocker) first
</Callout>

## Steps

### Default Mode

In default mode

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker' /> in the sidebar

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='edit' /> and click on individual games to add and remove them, and then click <MockButton type='done' />

    {<h3 />}
    Optionally, you can customize the unlock order and set unlock delays for individual achievements by [following these steps](#custom-order--unlock-delay)

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker-action' />
</Steps>

### Custom Order & Unlock Delay

The `custom order` feature allows you to specify the exact order in which achievements are unlocked for each game. You can drag and drop achievements to rearrange their order, and you can also choose to skip certain achievements if you don't want them to be unlocked.

The `unlock delay` is the amount of time SGI will wait after unlocking a specific achievement before unlocking the next one. For example, if you set a delay of 10 minutes on achievement 1, SGI will unlock achievement 1, wait 10 minutes, and then unlock achievement 2.

The custom `unlock delay` takes precedence over the value set in the [Settings → General → Unlock Interval](/docs/settings/achievement-unlocker#unlock-interval). If no custom delay is set for an achievement, SGI will use the value from the settings.

All steps are optional. You can choose to only customize the unlock order, only set the delay between achievements, or do both.

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker' /> in the sidebar

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='edit' /> and click on individual games to add and remove them, and then click <MockButton type='done' />

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='unlock-order' /> under the game you want to customize

    {<h3 />}
    Drag and drop achievements by grabbing the <MockButton type='grabber' /> to set their unlock order

    {<h3 />}
    Uncheck any achievements you want to exclude from being unlocked

    {<h3 />}
    Click `+ Add a delay after unlocking this achievement` on each achievement that you want to set a custom delay for and set the delay (in minutes)

    If an achievement already has a delay set, you can click `✔ Edit delay` to change or clear it

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='save-alt' /> and then click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker-action' />
</Steps>

## Additional Information

- You can add as many games as you want to your achievement unlocker list.
- SGI will only unlock achievements for **one game at a time** to make it look legitimate. When all achievements for that game are unlocked, SGI will start on the next game in your list.
- If you want to unlock achievements for multiple games at the same time, you can run more than one instance SGI, and choose a different game for each instance.
