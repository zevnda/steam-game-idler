# Achievement Unlocker

The Steam Achievement Unlocker feature will automatically unlock your Steam game's achievements in a way that looks like they were earned naturally.

<Callout type="info">
    Configure the features settings in [Settings → Achievement Unlocker](/docs/settings/achievement-unlocker) first
</Callout>

## Steps

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker' /> in the sidebar

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='edit' /> and click on individual games to add and remove them, and then click <MockButton type='done' />

    {<h3 />}
    Optionally, you can customize the order in which achievements are unlocked by clicking the <MockButton type='unlock-order' /> button below the game and dragging and dropping achievements into your desired order, then clicking <MockButton type='save-alt' />

    You can also uncheck the checkbox next to any achievement that you do not want Achievement Unlocker to unlock for you

    By default, SGI will unlock achievements in order of their global `achieved` percentage, from highest to lowest

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker-action' />
</Steps>

## Additional Information

- You can add as many games as you want to your achievement unlocker list.
- SGI will only unlock achievements for **one game at a time** to make it look legitimate. When all achievements for that game are unlocked, SGI will start on the next game in your list.
- If you want to unlock achievements for multiple games at the same time, you can run more than one instance SGI, and choose a different game for each instance.
