</Callout>

## Steps

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker' /> in the sidebar

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='edit' /> and click on individual games to add and remove them

## Additional Information

- You can add as many games as you want to your achievement unlocker list.
- SGI will only unlock achievements for **one game at a time** to make it look legitimate. When all achievements for that game are unlocked, SGI will start on the next game in your list.
- If you want to unlock achievements for multiple games at the same time, you can run more than one instance SGI, and choose a different game for each instance.
