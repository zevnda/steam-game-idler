# Achievement Manager

The Steam Achievement Manager feature allows you to manage your Steam game's achievements, including manually unlocking and locking achievements, as well as modifying an achievement's statistics.

If you have previously used Steam Achievement Manager (SAM) by Gibbed in the past, then SGI's Achievement Manager should feel familiar.

## Steps

### Achievements

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='your-games' /> in the sidebar

    {<h3 />}
    Click <Icon type='award' /> beneath the game image to view the `achievement manager` screen

    {<h3 />}
    On the `achievement manager` screen you will see a list of achievements for that game, if any are available

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='unlock' /> or <MockButton type='lock' /> next to an achievement to unlock or lock that specific achievement

    Click <MockButton type='unlock-all' /> or <MockButton type='lock-all' /> at the top of the achievements list to unlock or lock all achievements for that game
</Steps>

### Statistics

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='your-games' /> in the sidebar

    {<h3 />}
    Click <Icon type='award' /> beneath the game image to view the `achievement manager` screen

    {<h3 />}
    On the `achievement manager` screen click the <MockButton type='statistics-tab' /> tab. You will see a list of statistics for that game, if any are available

    {<h3 />}
    Change the `value` of any statistics you want to modify and click <MockButton type='save-changes' />
</Steps>

## Additional Information

Some achievements and statistics have special flags:

- **Protected:** Only official game servers can change these. You won't be able to change these in SGI.
- **IncrementOnly:** You can only increase these values, not decrease them (5 → 6 is allowed, but 5 → 4 is not).
- **Hidden:** The achievement description is hidden, so it’s harder to know how to unlock it.

SGI will show these flags next to each achievement or statistic.
