# Achievement Manager

The Steam Achievement Manager feature allows you to manage your Steam game's achievements, including manually unlocking and locking achievements, as well as modifying an achievement's statistics.

If you have previously used Steam Achievement Manager (SAM) by Gibbed in the past, then SGI's Achievement Manager should feel familiar.

    You can use the search bar at the top of the achievement manager screen to
    search for an achievement by its title

## Steps

### Achievements

## Additional Information

Some game developers set specific flags for their achievements and statistics, such as `Protected`, `IncrementOnly`, and `Hidden`. SGI will display these flags next to the achievement or statistic.
- `Protected` achievements and statistics can only be modified by official game servers
- `IncrementOnly` statistics means the value can only be increased, not decreased *(i.e. 5 -> 6, not 5 -> 4)*
- `Hidden` achievements hide their description making it harder to know how to unlock them
