# Free Games

SGI will periodically check the Steam store for free games and notify you when new ones are available. This feature helps you discover and claim free games that you might otherwise miss.

<Callout type="info">
  Games that you already own and DLC are filtered out, so you only see new free games that you can claim.
</Callout>
