# Card Farming

The Card Farming feature turns SGI into a powerful Steam trading card idler, automatically idling games in your library that still have trading card drops available. This Steam card idler functionality allows you to maximize your card collection efficiently.

You have two options for farming cards: 
* [Farm cards for games in the Card Farming list](/docs/features/card-farming#farm-specific-games-card-farming-list)
* [Farm cards for all games with card drops remaining](/docs/features/card-farming#farm-all-games-all-games-with-drops-remaining)

<Callout type="info">
    You must add your [Steam Credentials](/docs/steam-credentials) in [Settings → General → Steam Credentials](/docs/settings/general) before you can use the Card Farming feature
</Callout>

## Steps

### Farm Specific Games (Card Farming List)

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Enable [`Farm Games In List`](/docs/settings/card-farming#farm-games-in-list) in <MockButton type='context-cog' content='Settings → Card Farming' />

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='card-farming' /> in the sidebar

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='edit' /> and click on individual games to add and remove them

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='done' /> and then <MockButton type='card-farming-action' />

</Steps>

### Farm All Games (All Games With Drops Remaining)

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}

## Additional Information

- **New Steam accounts** and accounts that have **recently refunded a game** may sometimes have to wait three hours before the first card will drop.
- **Card drop times vary:** Some games drop a card every 30 minutes, while others may take 60, 90, or 120 minutes.
- You can add **as many games as you want** to your card farming list, but Steam only allows farming cards from **up to 32 games at the same time**.
- When a game has **no card drops left**, it will be removed from the list and SGI will start farming the next available game.
- While farming cards, you may see `SteamUtility (idle)` processes start and stop. This is normal — SGI uses the following method to farm cards as quickly as possible:

    ```
    1. Idle each game for 5 minutes
    2. Stop idling for 1 minute
    3. Idle each game for 15 seconds (first card drop should happen here)
    4. Stop idling for 1 minute
    5. Idle each game for 30 minutes
    6. Stop idling for 1 minute
    7. Idle each game for 15 seconds (next card drop should happen here)
    8. Stop idling for 1 minute
    9. Repeat the process
    ```
