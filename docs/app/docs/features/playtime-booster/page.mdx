# Playtime Booster

The Steam Playtime Booster feature is similar to Idle Master Extended and allows you to idle one or more games manually to boost their total playtime.

<Callout type="info">
    You can idle a maximum of 32 games simultaneously. This is a Steam limitation
</Callout>

## Steps

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='your-games' /> in the sidebar

    {<h3 />}
    Click <Icon type='playalt' /> beneath the game image to begin idling the game

    {<h3 />}
    Click <MockButton type='idling-games' /> in the sidebar to view the games you are currently idling
</Steps>

## Additional Information

- When you idle games with Playtime Booster, SGI opens extra `SteamUtility (idle)` windows to make Steam think you are playing those games. These windows will close when you stop idling.
- If you used Idle Master Extended before, Playtime Booster works in a similar way but is easier to use, and does not need any extra setup or configuration. Just pick the games you want to idle and start boosting your playtime.
