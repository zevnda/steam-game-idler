# Automatic Idler

The Steam Automatic Idler feature allows you to automatically idle your Steam games when SGI is launched. This is useful for users who want to consistently boost playtime on specific games without having to manually idle them each time.

This makes for a hassle-free playtime boosting experience when paired with the `run at startup` option in [Settings > General](/docs/settings/general).

<Callout type="info">
    You can idle a maximum of 32 games at once. This is a Steam limitation
