# Task Scheduling

Automation tasks such as [Card Farming](docs/features/card-farming), [Achievement Unlocker](docs/features/achievement-unlocker), and [Automatic Idler](docs/features/auto-idler) can be scheduled to run after another feature finishes.

For example, when Card Farming is finished, you can automatically run the Achievement Unlocker. Or when the Achievement Unlocker is finished, you can automatically run the Automatic Idler.

You can chain tasks together to create a workflow that suits your needs.

## Steps

<Steps>
  {<h3 />}
  Click <Icon type='cog' /> in the `sidebar`

  {<h3 />}
  In both the [Card Farming](docs/settings/card-farming) and [Achievement Unlocker](docs/settings/achievement-unlocker) settings tabs, you can configure the next task to run automatically by enabling the `run next task automatically` option and selecting the task you want to run next.
