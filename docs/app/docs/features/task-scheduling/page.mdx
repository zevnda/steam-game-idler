# Task Scheduling

Automation tasks such as [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming), [Achievement Unlocker](/docs/features/achievement-unlocker), and [Automatic Idler](/docs/features/auto-idler) can be scheduled to run after another feature finishes.

For example, when Card Farming is finished, you can automatically run the Achievement Unlocker. Or when the Achievement Unlocker is finished, you can automatically run the Automatic Idler.

You can chain tasks together to create a workflow that suits your needs.

## Steps

<Steps>
  {<h3 />}
  Click <MockButton type='context-cog' content='Settings' /> in the sidebar

  {<h3 />}
  In both the [Card Farming](/docs/settings/card-farming) and [Achievement Unlocker](/docs/settings/achievement-unlocker) settings tabs, you can configure the next task to run automatically once the current task is finished by enabling the [`Schedule Next Task`](/docs/settings/card-farming#schedule-next-task) option and selecting the task you want to run next.
