# How to manually add games

In some cases, SGI may not automatically detect all the games in your Steam library, [learn why here](/docs/faq#:~:text=Why%20are%20some%20games%20not%20showing%20up%20in%20my%20games%20list%20in%20SGI).

When this happens, you can manually add games to SGI to ensure they are included in features like Card Farming, Achievement Unlocker, and Automatic Idler.

## Steps

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click either <MockButton type='card-farming' />, <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker' />, <MockButton type='auto-idle' />, or <MockButton type='favorites' /> in the sidebar, depending on which list you want to add the game to

    {<h3 />}
    Click on the <MockButton type='context-add' /> button in the page header

    {<h3 />}
    In the modal that opens, enter the `game name` and `game id` of the game you want to add

    You can find the `game id` in the URL of the game's store page. For example, in the URL `https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/`, the game ID is `570`

    {<h3 />}
    Click the <MockButton type='content' content='Add' /> button to add the game to the selected list
