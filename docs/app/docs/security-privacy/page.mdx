# Security & Privacy

Your security and privacy are important. This page explains how Steam Game Idler handles your data and what security measures are in place.

## Data We Collect

### Local Data Only
SGI stores all your data locally on your computer. No personal information is sent to external servers except for direct communication with Steam's official API.

### What's Stored Locally
- **Steam account information**: Basic profile data retrieved from Steam
- **Game library data**: Information about games you own (retrieved from Steam)
- **Application settings**: Your preferences, lists, and configuration
- **Steam credentials**: Encrypted cookies for card farming functionality
- **Log files**: Debug information for troubleshooting

### What We Don't Collect
- **Personal identification**: No real names, addresses, or personal details
- **Financial information**: No payment methods or purchasing history
- **Private communications**: No chat logs or private messages
- **Usage analytics**: No tracking of how you use the application

## Steam API Usage

### Official Steam API
SGI only uses Steam's official, public APIs that are available to all developers. We don't use any unofficial methods or exploits.

### API Calls Made
- **Profile data**: Public profile information
- **Game library**: Games you own and their basic information
- **Achievement data**: Achievement information for games you own
- **Trading card data**: Card drop information (requires Steam credentials)

### Rate Limiting
SGI respects Steam's API rate limits to avoid overwhelming their servers and ensure reliable service.

## Steam Credentials

### Why We Need Them
Steam credentials (cookies) are required for certain features like card farming. These allow SGI to check which games have card drops remaining. You provide credentials manually - we never automatically capture them

### What We Do With Them
- **Card drop checking**: Verify which games have trading cards available
- **Trading card management**: List and manage your trading cards
- **Nothing else**: Credentials are only used for Steam-related functionality

<Callout type="error">
    Never share your Steam credentials with anyone. Only enter them in SGI's settings page.
</Callout>

## Network Communication

### Steam & GitHub Servers Only
SGI communicates only with Steam's official servers and GitHub for automatic updates. No third-party services are used.

### Encrypted Connections
All communication with Steam uses HTTPS encryption to protect your data in transit.

### Firewall Permissions
SGI requires network access to communicate with Steam. This is why Windows may prompt you to allow SGI through the firewall.

## Open Source Transparency

### Full Source Code
SGI is completely open source. You can review the entire codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/zevnda/steam-game-idler) to see exactly what the application does. The open-source nature allows security researchers and the community to audit the code for potential issues.

### No Bans
SGI uses official Steam APIs and mimics normal user behavior, making it extremely unlikely to result in any Steam account penalties.

### Regular Updates
We monitor Steam's API changes and update SGI accordingly to maintain compliance and functionality.

## Data Retention

### Local Storage Only
Your data is stored only on your local computer. SGI doesn't maintain any user databases or cloud storage.

### Uninstallation
When you uninstall SGI, you can choose to delete all stored data including settings and credentials.

### Code Signing
Release builds of SGI are digitally signed to verify authenticity and prevent tampering.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability in SGI:

1. **Don't create a public issue** - this could put other users at risk
2. **Contact the maintainer directly** through GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. **Provide detailed information** about the issue and how to reproduce it
4. **Allow time for a fix** before public disclosure

<Callout type="info">
    Security vulnerabilities will be prioritized and fixed as quickly as possible
</Callout>
