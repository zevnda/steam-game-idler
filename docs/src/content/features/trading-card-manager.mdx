## Steps

### Sell Individual Cards

<Steps>
    {<h3 />}
    Click <Icon type='market' /> in the `sidebar`

    Find a card that you want to sell and input a sale price for it

    {<h3 />}
    You can click `show market prices` to fetch the current market price for the card. This will show you the `lowest price` and `median price` for the card
    <Callout type="info">
      You can click the `lowest price` or `median price` to set the sale price for the card
    </Callout>

    {<h3 />}
    Once you have set the price for the card you want to sell, click <MockButton type='sell' /> to list the card for sale on the Steam marketplace

    {<h3 />}
    If you have Two-Factor Authentication *(2FA)* or Steam Guard enabled on your account, you will need to confirm the listing via the Steam mobile app or via email depending on which you use. SGI will usually tell you which method you need to use

## Additional Information

Steam has rate limts in place for listing cards for sale. If you try to list too many cards at once, you may receive an error message from Steam. If this happens, you will need to wait an undiscosed amount of time before you can list more cards

The checkbox for each card will be automatically checked when entering a sale price greater than `$0.00`. Setting the price to `$0.00` will uncheck the checkbox for that card, or you can manually check or uncheck the checkbox for any card

If you manually check the checkbox you will need to set a price greater than `$0.00` for the card to be sold

Not all cards have `lowest price` and `median price` data available. I believe market price data is only available if the card has been sold on the Steam marketplace in the last 30 days

When you list, sell or earn a new trading card, you will need to manually refresh the Trading Card Manager to see the changes. You can do this by clicking the <Icon type='refresh' /> button in the page header
