### Improved 🚀
- Valve has made some changes to how the Beta Steam client stores achievement data. These changes are likely to be part of the next Stable client update, so I have preemptively added a fix for the new data structure to ensure that achievements continue to load correctly for both the new Beta and current Stable users. This update should prevent any issues with achievement loading once the changes are rolled out to the Stable client.
