### New 🎉
- **Trading Card Manager**: Added a cooldown when manually fetching price data via the show market prices button. This won't completely prevent being rate-limited, but it should do better at letting users know not to spam that action

### Improved 🚀
- **Trading Card Manager**: Improved the way we handle being rate-limited in both `fetchCardPrices()` and `handleSellAllCards()`. In both cases, a toast will be shown to the user. When hitting a rate limit while selling cards, we now exit the function completely to prevent trying to list further cards, and a more descriptive error message is logged
