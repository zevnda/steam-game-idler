### New 🎉
- Added a live support chat for one-on-one support
  - Acces the live support chat by clicking the `support` icon in the `title bar`
- Added a `close to tray` option to `settings > general` (#1020)
  - When enabled, clicking the X button in the `title bar` will minimize SGI to the system tray and it will continue to run in the background
  - When disabled, clicking the X button in the `title bar` will fully close SGI, exiting the application completely
