### Improved 🚀
- Use a more secure method for checking if the user has an active **PRO** subscription by calling an external API instead of interacting with the database directly within the application. This is a breaking change which means users will need to update to this version or later to continue using **PRO** features.

### Fixed 🐛
- Fixed an issue where using a decimal value in the "**Custom Delay**" for "**Achievement Unlocker**" and pressing the enter key would cause a validation error, even if the value was within the allowed range
