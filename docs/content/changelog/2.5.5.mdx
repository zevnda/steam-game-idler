### Improved 🚀
- Added a check when starting to idle a game to prevent exceeding the maximum of 32 concurrent idling games. This isn't necessarily a bad thing if you exceed the limit, those games just wont be recognized by the Steam client, but it helps avoid wasted resources and potential issues

### Fixed 🐛
- Fixed an issue where idling a game from "**Your Games**" would cause the component to rerender a bunch of times
- Fixed an issue where the changelog modal would sometimes load the incorrect version after an update
