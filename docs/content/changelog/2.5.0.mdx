### New 🎉
- **Customization Settings**: There is a new "**Customization**" tab in the settings menu for customizing the appearance and behavior of SGI. Some existing settings have been moved here for better organization, such as "**Disable Tooltops**" and "**Chat Notification Volume**"
- **New PRO Features**: Completely personalize SGI with 4 new themes — **Blue**, **Red**, **Purple**, and **Black** — as well as custom app backgrounds. All available in the new **Customization** tab
- **Zoom Controls**: Added keyboard shortcuts for control over the UI scale
  - `Ctrl` + `+` to zoom in
  - `Ctrl` + `-` to zoom out
  - `Ctrl` + `0` to reset zoom to default

### Improved 🚀
- **Default Theme**: The default theme has been overhauled with improved colors, contrast, and readability

### Fixed 🐛
- **Sidebar Resizing**: Fixed an issue where the sidebar would get squished when running on smaller screens making it impossible to click on some sidebar items
