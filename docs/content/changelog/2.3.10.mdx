### New 🎉
- Added a settings button to the page header of `card farming`, `achievement unlocker`, and `trading card manager`
  - Allows users to easily access settings pages specific to those features
- Added an `alert` to the `card farming` and `trading card manager` pages to notify users to add `steam credentials` before trying to use the feature

### Fixed 🐛
- Fixed an incorrect condition in the `card farming` UI which caused it to show as "Done" immediately after starting the feature
