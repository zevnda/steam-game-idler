### Improved 🚀
- Improved the look of the `sidebar`
  - Grouped related items/features into categories 
  - Added current user information to the lower section with `settings` and `sign out` buttons
- Improved the logic for getting a user's `games with card drops remaining`
  - Removed a early return condition which could cause some games with completed badges, but also with card drops remaining, to not be returned
  - SGI will now parse all user badges pages `https://steamcommunity.com/my/badges/`
  - While this change is more robust, it also means that it may take longer to fetch this data for users with a lot of badges
- To avoid confusion, the `free games` item in the `sidebar` will now always be visible
  - When there are free games available for you to claim, the `free games` button will be gold, and the available games will be shown in the list
  - You will still receive desktop notifications *(if enabled)* when free games are available for you to claim
  - `free games` has been moved to the new `games` cateogry in the `sidebar`

### Fixed 🐛
- Fixed an infinite loading issue on the `sign in` screen when no Steam users were found
