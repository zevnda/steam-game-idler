### Improved 🎉
- **Automated Steam Credentials Improvements**: SGI will now attempt to refresh Steam credentials when they are needed. This means basically full automation of Steam credential management for **PRO** users. If automatic validation does happen to fail, the user can still manually use the "**Reauthenticate**" button in the "**Steam Credentials**" settings
