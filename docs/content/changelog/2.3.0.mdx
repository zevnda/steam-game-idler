### New 🎉
- Added custom achievement order for the Achievement Unlocker feature
  - Users can now customize the order in which achievements are unlocked for games in Achievement Unlocker
  - Click the sort icon *(up and down arrow)* on any game in the Achievement Unlocker list to open the achievement order modal
  - Drag and drop achievements to set your preferred unlock order
  - Custom orders are saved per game and will be used instead of the default percentage-based ordering
  - If no custom order exists, achievements will still be unlocked from highest to lowest global achieved percentage

### Improved 🚀
- Offline users are now hidden in the user list in chat
