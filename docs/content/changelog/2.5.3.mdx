### New 🎉
- **New Themes**: Added two new **PRO** themes, "**Pink**" and "**Gold**", available in the **Customization** settings tab

### Improved 🚀
- **Performance**: Moved frequent heavy operations to the Rust backend. This has significantly improved memory usage and overall application responsiveness, especially on lower-end systems
- Tweaked the "**Default**" theme for better consistency across components
- Other minor visual improvements across all themes for a more polished look

### Fixed 🐛
- Fixed an issue with the game card idle timers which could cause a slight memory leak over time, especially when idling many games simultaneously
- Fixed an issue where zoom controls (`Ctrl` + `+` / `-` / `0`) were not working if another element had focus
