### New 🎉
- **Blacklisting Games**: You can now blacklist specific games from being farmed for cards in the "**Card Farming**" feature. You can do this by clicking the "**Edit List**" button in the "**Card Farming**" screen and then clicking the "**Blacklist**" button next to individual games. Blacklisted games will not be farmed for cards in either mode, even if they have card drops remaining, and even if you have added them to your card farming list.

### Improved 🚀
- Improved the way the UI looks in certain areas when viewed on different monitor sizes, including ultrawide monitors

### Fixed 🐛
- Fixed an issue in chat where mentioned users would not be highlighted correctly in messages
