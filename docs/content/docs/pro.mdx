    Chargebacks are when a payment made on your credit card or bank account is reversed, typically when the customer disputes a charge or claims it was unauthorized.

    Steam Game Idler is a small independent project, and fraudulent chargebacks have a significant negative impact.

    If a chargeback is filed on your **PRO** subscription without prior communication, your access to Steam Game Idler and all of its features may be revoked permanently.

    If you believe a charge was made to your account in error, please contact support via the in-app help desk or send an email to contact@steamgameidler.com.
