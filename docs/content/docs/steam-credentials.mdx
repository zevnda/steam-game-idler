# Steam Credentials

SGI needs your Steam credentials for the [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming) and [Trading Card Manager](/docs/features/trading-card-manager) features.

Steam credentials are used to verify which of your games have card drops remaining, as well as fetching and listing your trading cards on the Steam market.

SGI offers both a [**Manual Method**](/docs/steam-credentials#manual-method) and an [**Automated Method (PRO)**](/docs/steam-credentials#automated-method) for providing your Steam credentials.

<Callout title='Do not share these credentials with anyone' type='error'>
  These credentials allow limited access to your Steam account, but they do not allow access to changing your password, email address, or other sensitive information
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  You must get your cookies from https://steamcommunity.com/ and not https://store.steampowered.com/
