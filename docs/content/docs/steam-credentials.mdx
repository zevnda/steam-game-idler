# Steam Credentials

SGI needs your Steam credentials for the [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming) and [Trading Card Manager](/docs/features/trading-card-manager) features.

This allows SGI to verify which of your games have card drops remaining, as well as managing your Steam market listings.

SGI offers both a [**Manual Method**](/docs/steam-credentials#manual-method) and an [**Automated Method (PRO)**](/docs/steam-credentials#automated-method) for providing your Steam credentials.

<Callout title='Do not share these credentials with anyone' type='error'>
  These credentials allow limited access to your Steam account, but they do not allow access to changing your password, email address, or other sensitive information

  You must get your cookies from https://steamcommunity.com/ and not https://store.steampowered.com/
