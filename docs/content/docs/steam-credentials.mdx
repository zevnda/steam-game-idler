# Steam Credentials

SGI needs your Steam credentials for the [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming) and [Trading Card Manager](/docs/features/trading-card-manager) features.

This allows SGI to verify which of your games have card drops remaining, as well as managing your Steam market listings.
