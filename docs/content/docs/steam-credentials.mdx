# Steam Credentials

SGI needs your Steam credentials for the [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming) and [Trading Card Manager](/docs/features/trading-card-manager) features.

This allows SGI to verify which of your games have card drops remaining, as well as managing your Steam market listings.

## Semi-Automatic Method (recommended)

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Open SGI and Navigate to the Settings

    Open SGI and go to [<MockButton type='context-cog' content='Settings → Steam Credentials' />](/docs/steam-credentials)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Sign In via Steam

    Click the <MockButton type='content' content='Sign In via Steam' /> button to open a browser to the Steam Community login page
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Log In to Your Steam Account

    In the opened window, log in to your Steam account using either:
    - Your username and password
    - The QR code via the Steam Mobile App
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Automatic Cookie Retrieval

    Once you successfully sign in, SGI will automatically detect and retrieve your `sessionid` and `steamLoginSecure` cookies. The window will automatically close after the cookies are captured (this happens within seconds)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    ### Confirmation

    <Steps>
      <Step>
        If successful you should see a new panel with your Steam avatar, games with drops count, and total drops remaining count
      </Step>
      <Step>
        If you get an error, double-check your credentials and try these steps again
      </Step>
    </Steps>

      </Step>
