# Free Games Settings

## Free Game Notifications
Get native Windows notifications when free Steam games are available to add to your account

SGI will exclude games that you already own, but you will need to make sure your games list data is up to date by clicking the <MockButton type='content' content='Refresh' /> button in <MockButton type='your-games' />

## Auto Redeem Free Games
Automatically redeem free Steam games to your account when they become available

This feature requires you to sign in to your Steam account with the <MockButton type='content' content='Sign In via Steam' /> button and remain signed in for this feature to work

It is recommended to turn off [Free Game Notifications](/docs/settings/free-games#free-game-notifications) if you enable this feature, as you will not need to manually claim free games anymore
