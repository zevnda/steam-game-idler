# General

## Always Online
Prevents Steam from setting your status as away while SGI is running

When enabled, SGI will automatically change your Steam status back to online if you manually set it to away, offline, invisible, or any other status while the application is running

## Beta Features
Enable beta features that are not yet available in the stable version of SGI

Beta features may be unstable, change unexpectedly, or be removed at any time. If you experience any issues when using a beta feature, please report it on GitHub

## Run At Startup
Automatically launch SGI when Windows starts by adding it to your startup programs

This allows you to have SGI running in the background without needing to manually start it each time you log in to Windows

## Start Minimized
Start SGI minimized to the system tray instead of showing the main window on startup. The app will remain hidden until manually opened via the system tray icon

## Close to Tray
Clicking the X button will minimize SGI to the system tray instead of closing it

When enabled, to fully exit the app, right-click the system tray icon and select `Quit`

## Language
Choose the language you want SGI to be displayed in. The language should be set automatically based on your system language, but you can change it to any of the supported languages

## Currency
Choose the currency you want to use when displaying prices in SGI, such as for [Trading Card Manager](/docs/features/trading-card-manager)

This currency will also be used to determine the sell price for trading cards

## Steam Web API Key
Allows users to provide their own Steam Web API key to fetch profile and game data. API keys are free for all users with a Steam account, you can [get yours here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)
  - Useful if users want to keep their Steam profile and game details set to private
  - The API key must belong to the same account you're logged into in SGI. If using multiple accounts, you must set the API key for each account separately
  - Some features may still be limited with private profiles
