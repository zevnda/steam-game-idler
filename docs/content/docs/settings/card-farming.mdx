# Card Farming Settings

## Farm Games In List
SGI will only farm cards for games that you've manually added to your Card Farming list, ignoring all others

## Farm All Games
SGI will automatically farm cards for all games in your library that still have trading card drops available

You can see which games in your Steam library have card drops remaining on your [Badges Page](https://steamcommunity.com/my/badges/)

## Skip Unplayed Games
When enabled, SGI will skip any games that have not been played yet *(0 playtime)* during the card farming process

## Schedule Next Task
Automatically start the selected feature when Card Farming finishes

For example, if you select "Achievement Unlocker", it will automatically start the Achievement Unlocker feature after Card Farming finishes
