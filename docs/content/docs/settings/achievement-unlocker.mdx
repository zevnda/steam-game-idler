# Achievement Unlocker Settings

## Idle Game
While Achievement Unlocker is running, SGI will idle the game that it is currently unlocking achievements for

This is useful for making sure the game's playtime is also increased, making it look more legitimate

## Skip Hidden Achievements
Achievements that are listed as `hidden` by the game developer will be skipped

## Schedule Next Task
Automatically start the selected feature when Achievement Unlocker finishes

For example, if you select "Card Farming", it will automatically start the Card Farming feature after Achievement Unlocker finishes

## Time Range
Choose a time range for when SGI should unlock achievements. When outside of your scheduled time range, Achievement Unlocker will continue to run, but it will not unlock achievements. It will begin unlocking achievements again when back inside the scheduled time range

## Unlock Interval
This will determine how often SGI will unlock a new achievement _(in minutes)_.

After unlocking an achievement, SGI starts a countdown using a random time within your specified range. For example, with a range of `60 to 180 minutes`, SGI selects a random waiting period between 1-3 hours before unlocking the next achievement and starting a new countdown.
