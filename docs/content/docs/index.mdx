# Introduction

Steam Game Idler (SGI) is a Steam automation tool for farming trading cards, managing achievements, and boosting playtime across all games in your Steam library.

This project was born out of frustration with alternatives like ArchiSteamFarm, Steam Achievement Manager and Idle Master, which often lacked key features, were overly complex to set up, had ugly or outdated user interfaces, or suffered from bugs and infrequent updates.

SGI combines the best aspects of these tools into a single, modern, free, and easy-to-use application.
