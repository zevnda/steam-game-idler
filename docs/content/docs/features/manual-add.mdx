# Manually Adding Games

In some cases, SGI may not automatically detect all the games in your Steam library [for reasons explained here](/docs/faq#:~:text=Why%20are%20some%20games%20not%20showing%20up%20in%20my%20games%20list%20in%20SGI%3F).

When this happens, you can manually add games to SGI to ensure they are included in features like [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming), [Achievement Unlocker](/docs/features/achievement-unlocker), and [Automatic Idler](/docs/features/auto-idler).

<Callout type="info">
    Adding games manually does not always guarantee that all SGI features will work correctly with those games

  <Step>
    In the modal that opens, enter the `game name` and `game id` of the game you want to add

    The `game id` is the number in the game's store page URL. For example, here it is `570`:

    https://store.steampowered.com/app/570/Dota_2/
