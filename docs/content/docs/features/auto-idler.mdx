# Auto-Idle Steam Games on Startup

The Steam Automatic Idler feature allows you to automatically idle your Steam games when SGI is launched. This is useful for users who want to consistently boost playtime on specific games without having to manually idle them each time.

This makes for a hassle-free playtime boosting experience when used with the [Run At Startup](/docs/settings/general#run-at-startup) setting.
