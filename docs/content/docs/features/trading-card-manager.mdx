## Removing Listings

Click <MockButton type='remove-all'/> to remove all your active trading card listings from the Steam marketplace.

## Pricing Details

When you use <MockButton type='list-all' />, SGI will list each card at its `highest_buy_order`. If that price isn't available, it will use its `lowest_sell_order`. If neither price is available, the card won't be listed.

You can choose which option to use by default by changing the [Default Sell Option](/docs/settings/trading-card-manager#default-sell-option) in the settings.

## Marketplace Fees

Steam charges a [15% transaction fee](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/61F0-72B7-9A18-C70B#steamfee) on each marketplace sale, which is made up of two parts:
- **Steam Transaction Fee (5%)**: This goes to Valve for facilitating the transaction.
- **Game Publisher Fee (10%)**: This goes to the publisher of the game the card is from (not just Valve games—all publishers receive this fee for their own items).

SGI automatically subtracts the 15% Steam transaction fee when you set a sale price.
> If you set a price of `$0.50`, SGI will list the card for `$0.44`. This ensures that after fees, you receive the exact amount you listed the card for.
