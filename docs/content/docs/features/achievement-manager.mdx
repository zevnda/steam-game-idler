## Special Flags

Some games have achievements and statistics with [special flags](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/achievements#3) set by the develper:
- **Protected:** Only official game servers can change these. You won't be able to change these in SGI
- **IncrementOnly:** You can only increase this statistic's value, not decrease it (5 → 6 is allowed, but 5 → 4 is not)
- **Hidden:** The achievement description is hidden, so it’s harder to know how to unlock it

For statistics with any flags, the flags will be shown under the statistic in the statistics tab.

For achievements with the "Hidden" flag, the description will be blurred until you hover over it with your mouse.

For achievements with the "Protected" flag, the unlock/lock buttons will be disabled.

## What is a Steam Achievement Manager?

A Steam Achievement Manager is a tool that allows you to manually control your Steam game achievements outside of normal gameplay. These tools interact with Steam's API to unlock or lock achievements, modify achievement statistics, and manage your gaming profile.

Steam achievement managers are commonly used to:
- Restore achievements lost due to save file corruption or game bugs
- Test achievement functionality for game developers
- Complete achievement collections for games you've already beaten
- Fix achievements that didn't unlock properly during gameplay
- Manage achievement statistics and counters

SGI's Achievement Manager works similarly to SAM (Steam Achievement Manager) by Gibbed, but offers a modern interface and additional features like bulk operations and statistics editing.

## Why Use SGI's Steam Achievement Manager?

**Modern Interface**: Unlike older achievement unlocker tools, SGI provides a clean, intuitive interface that makes achievement management simple and straightforward.

**Safe & Reliable**: SGI uses official Steam API methods to manage achievements, ensuring compatibility and safety for your Steam account.

**Bulk Operations**: Unlock or lock all achievements for a game with a single click, saving time when managing large achievement lists.

**Statistics Support**: Beyond just unlocking achievements, you can also modify achievement statistics and counters that many games use for progression tracking.

**Active Development**: SGI is actively maintained and updated to support the latest Steam features and games, unlike legacy tools that may no longer be supported.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is using a Steam achievement manager safe?

Steam achievement managers interact with Steam's official API. While using achievement managers is against Steam's Subscriber Agreement, VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) bans are game-specific and typically only triggered by cheating in multiplayer games. Achievement unlocking has not historically resulted in VAC bans, though use any achievement manager at your own discretion.

### Can I get banned for using a Steam achievement unlocker?

Achievement managers do not typically result in bans. However, they do violate Steam's terms of service. Steam has not historically banned accounts for achievement unlocking, but use responsibly and at your own risk.

### How is SGI different from SAM (Steam Achievement Manager)?

SGI offers a more modern interface, active development, and additional features like statistics editing and bulk operations. While SAM by Gibbed pioneered achievement management tools, SGI provides an updated experience for current Steam users.

### Will unlocked achievements show in my Steam profile?

Yes, achievements unlocked through SGI will appear on your Steam profile just like naturally earned achievements. They are indistinguishable from achievements earned through normal gameplay.

### Can I lock achievements I've already unlocked?

Yes, SGI allows you to lock (remove) achievements you've previously unlocked. This is useful if you want to re-earn achievements or fix mistakes.

### Does the achievement manager work with all Steam games?

SGI's Achievement Manager works with any Steam game that has achievements. However, some games use protected achievements that cannot be modified even with achievement managers.

## Troubleshooting Achievement Manager Issues

### Achievements won't unlock
- Ensure Steam is running and you're logged in
- Verify the game supports achievements (check the Steam store page)
- Check if the achievement has a "Protected" flag that prevents modification
- Try restarting Steam after making changes

### Statistics won't save
- Some statistics have "IncrementOnly" flags that prevent decreasing values
- Protected statistics cannot be modified
- Ensure you click the "Save Changes" button after editing

### Changes not appearing in Steam
- Achievement changes may take a few moments to sync with Steam's servers
- Try restarting Steam to force a sync
- Check your Steam profile in a private/incognito browser window to see updated achievements
