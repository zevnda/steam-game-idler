## Special Flags

Some games have achievements and statistics with [special flags](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/achievements#3) set by the develper:
- **Protected:** Only official game servers can change these. You won't be able to change these in SGI
- **IncrementOnly:** You can only increase this statistic's value, not decrease it (5 → 6 is allowed, but 5 → 4 is not)
- **Hidden:** The achievement description is hidden, so it’s harder to know how to unlock it

For statistics with any flags, the flags will be shown under the statistic in the statistics tab.

For achievements with the "Hidden" flag, the description will be blurred until you hover over it with your mouse.

For achievements with the "Protected" flag, the unlock/lock buttons will be disabled.
