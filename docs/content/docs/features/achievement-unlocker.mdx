# How to Unlock Steam Achievements Automatically

The Steam Achievement Unlocker feature allows you to automatically unlock achievements for your Steam games over time, with customizable delays and ordering to mimic natural gameplay.

<Callout type="info">
    Configure this feature's settings in [Settings → Achievement Unlocker](/docs/settings/achievement-unlocker) before using it
</Callout>

### Default Mode

In default mode, achievements are unlocked in the order of global achievement percentage, with the delay set in [Settings → General → Unlock Interval](/docs/settings/achievement-unlocker#unlock-interval).

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker' /> in the sidebar
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click <MockButton type='edit' /> and click on individual games to add and remove them, and then click <MockButton type='content' content='Done' />
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Optionally, you can customize the unlock order and set delays for individual achievements by [following these steps](#custom-order--unlock-delay)
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker-action' />
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Custom Order & Unlock Delay

The `custom order` feature lets you set the exact order in which achievements are unlocked, and allows you to skip any that you don’t want unlocked.

The `unlock delay` is how long SGI waits after unlocking one achievement before unlocking the next.

> If you set a delay of 10 minutes on achievement one, SGI will unlock achievement one, wait 10 minutes, and then unlock achievement two.

Unlock delays override the global value set in [Settings → General → Unlock Interval](/docs/settings/achievement-unlocker#unlock-interval). If no unlock delay is set, the global value is used.

You can customize the order, set delays, or both — each step is optional.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Follow steps 1 and 2 from the [Default Mode](#default-mode) section above
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click <MockButton type='unlock-order' /> below the game you want to customize
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Drag and drop achievements by grabbing the <MockButton type='grabber' /> to set their unlock order
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click <MockButton type='checkbox' /> to uncheck achievements that you want to exclude from being unlocked
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click <MockButton type='content' content='+ Add a delay after unlocking this achievement' /> on each achievement that you want to set an unlock delay for and set the delay (in minutes)

    If an achievement already has a delay set, you can click <MockButton type='content' content='✔ Edit delay' /> to change or clear it
  </Step>

  <Step>
    Click <MockButton type='save-alt' /> and then click <MockButton type='achievement-unlocker-action' />
  </Step>
