# Card Farming

The Card Farming feature turns SGI into a powerful Steam trading card idler, automatically idling games in your library that still have trading card drops available. This Steam card idler functionality allows you to maximize your card collection efficiently.

## Account Restriction

New Steam accounts and accounts that have recently refunded a game fall under the [Limited User Account](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A) restrictions and may have to spend a minimum of **$5.00 USD**, and/or wait three hours before the first card will drop.

## Card Drop Times

The time it takes for cards to drop varies from game to game. This interval is set by the developer. Some games drop a card every 30 minutes, while others may take up to 2 hours.

## How It Works

You can add as many games as you want to your card farming list, but Steam only allows farming cards from up to 32 games at the same time.

When a game has no card drops left, it will be removed from the list and SGI will start farming the next available game.

While farming cards, you may see `SteamUtility.exe (idle)` processes start and stop. This is normal — SGI uses the following method to farm cards as quickly as possible:

```markdown
1. Idle each game for 5 minutes
2. Stop idling for 1 minute
3. Idle each game for 15 seconds (first card drop should happen here)
4. Stop idling for 1 minute
5. Idle each game for 30 minutes
6. Stop idling for 1 minute
7. Idle each game for 15 seconds (next card drop should happen here)
8. Stop idling for 1 minute
9. Repeat the process
```
