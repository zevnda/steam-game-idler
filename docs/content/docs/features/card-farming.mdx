# How to Farm Steam Trading Cards Automatically

The Card Farming feature allows you to automatically farm trading cards from your Steam games without needing to download or play them. This is ideal for users looking to collect cards for badge crafting or marketplace sales efficiently.

## Account Restriction

New Steam accounts and accounts that have recently refunded a game fall under the [Limited User Account](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A) restrictions and may have to spend a minimum of **$5.00 USD**, and/or wait three hours before the first card will drop.

## Card Drop Times

The time it takes for cards to drop varies from game to game. This interval is set by the developer. Some games drop a card every 30 minutes, while others may take up to 2 hours.

## Blacklisting Games
You can blacklist specific games from being farmed for cards by clicking the <MockButton type='edit' /> button and then clicking the <MockButton type='content' content='Blacklist' /> button next to individual games.

Blacklisted games will not be farmed for cards in either mode, even if they have card drops remaining, and even if you have added them to your card farming list.

## Card Farming Algorithm

While farming cards, you may see `SteamUtility.exe (idle)` processes start and stop. This is normal — SGI uses the following method to farm cards as quickly as possible:

```markdown
1. Idle each game for 5 minutes
2. Stop idling for 1 minute
3. Idle each game for 15 seconds (first card drop should happen here)
4. Stop idling for 1 minute
5. Idle each game for 30 minutes
6. Stop idling for 1 minute
7. Idle each game for 15 seconds (next card drop should happen here)
8. Stop idling for 1 minute
9. Repeat the process
```
