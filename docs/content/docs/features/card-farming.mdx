## Account Restriction

New Steam accounts and accounts that have recently refunded a game fall under the [Limited User Account](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/71D3-35C2-AD96-AA3A) restrictions and may have to spend a minimum of **$5.00 USD**, and/or wait three hours before the first card will drop.

## Card Drop Times

The time it takes for cards to drop varies from game to game. This interval is set by the developer. Some games drop a card every 30 minutes, while others may take up to 2 hours.

## Blacklisting Games
You can blacklist specific games from being farmed for cards by clicking the <MockButton type='edit' /> button and then clicking the <MockButton type='content' content='Blacklist' /> button next to individual games.

Blacklisted games will not be farmed for cards in either mode, even if they have card drops remaining, and even if you have added them to your card farming list.

## What is a Steam Card Farmer?

A Steam card farmer is an automated tool that idles Steam games in the background to collect trading card drops without requiring you to download, install, or actively play the games. Steam card farming tools simulate game playtime, triggering Steam's card drop system while you're away from your computer.

Steam card farmers are commonly used to:
- Collect trading cards from your entire game library automatically
- Earn Steam marketplace profits by selling farmed cards
- Level up your Steam account by crafting badges from collected card sets
- Farm cards from games you own but don't want to play
- Maximize card drops without consuming computer resources running actual games
- Build complete card collections for badge crafting

Card farming tools allow you to farm cards from multiple accounts simultaneously without requiring the official Steam client running in the background , making them significantly more efficient than manual card collection methods.

## Why Use SGI's Steam Card Farmer?

**Optimized Farming Algorithm**: SGI uses an intelligent card farming strategy that maximizes drop efficiency. Our algorithm idles games in short bursts followed by brief pauses to trigger card drops as quickly as possible, often faster than traditional continuous idling.

**Farm Up to 32 Games Simultaneously**: Steam allows farming cards from up to 30-32 games at the same time , and SGI fully utilizes this limit to maximize your card farming efficiency.

**No Game Downloads Required**: Unlike manually farming cards by running games, SGI's Steam card farmer doesn't require downloading or installing games. Simply add games to your farming list and let SGI handle the rest.

**Automatic Queue Management**: When a game runs out of card drops, SGI automatically removes it from the queue and starts farming the next available game, ensuring continuous card farming without manual intervention.

**Blacklist Support**: Exclude specific games from being farmed while still farming everything else in your library automatically.

**Farm All or Farm Selected**: Choose between farming all games with remaining drops or manually selecting specific games to farm for cards.

**Background Operation**: SGI runs quietly in the background, consuming minimal system resources while farming Steam cards continuously.

**Active Development**: Unlike legacy Steam card farming tools like Idle Master that are no longer actively maintained, SGI receives regular updates and support.

## How Steam Card Farming Works

Steam trading cards are digital collectibles that drop as you accumulate playtime in games that support them. Games must support trading cards, and your Steam account must have at least $5 in purchases to receive card drops .

When you farm cards with SGI, here's what happens:

1. **Game Selection**: SGI identifies all games in your library with remaining card drops available
2. **Simultaneous Idling**: Up to 32 games are idled simultaneously to meet the initial playtime requirement
3. **Optimized Card Drops**: SGI uses a specialized farming algorithm that alternates between idling periods and pauses to trigger card drops efficiently
4. **Automatic Rotation**: When a game has no more card drops, it's removed and replaced with the next game in your queue
5. **Continuous Farming**: The process repeats until all selected games have been farmed for cards

If a card set consists of eight cards, you will be awarded half—four cards from farming . The remaining cards must be obtained through trading or marketplace purchases to complete the set.

## SGI's Advanced Card Farming Algorithm

You can add as many games as you want to your card farming list, but Steam only allows farming cards from up to 32 games at the same time.

When a game has no card drops left, it will be removed from the list and SGI will start farming the next available game.

While farming cards, you may see `SteamUtility.exe (idle)` processes start and stop. This is normal — SGI uses the following method to farm cards as quickly as possible:

```markdown
1. Idle each game for 5 minutes
2. Stop idling for 1 minute
3. Idle each game for 15 seconds (first card drop should happen here)
4. Stop idling for 1 minute
5. Idle each game for 30 minutes
6. Stop idling for 1 minute
7. Idle each game for 15 seconds (next card drop should happen here)
8. Stop idling for 1 minute
9. Repeat the process
