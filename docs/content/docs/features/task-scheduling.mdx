# Task Scheduling

Automation tasks such as [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming), [Achievement Unlocker](/docs/features/achievement-unlocker), and [Automatic Idler](/docs/features/auto-idler) can be scheduled to run after another feature finishes.

For example, when Card Farming is finished, you can automatically run the Achievement Unlocker. Or when the Achievement Unlocker is finished, you can automatically run the Automatic Idler.

You can chain tasks together to create a workflow that suits your needs.
