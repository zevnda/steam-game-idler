# How to Schedule Automated Steam Game Tasks

The Task Scheduling feature allows you to automate the execution of various task such as [Card Farming](/docs/features/card-farming), [Achievement Unlocker](/docs/features/achievement-unlocker), and [Automatic Idler](/docs/features/auto-idler).

For example, when Card Farming is finished, you can automatically run the Achievement Unlocker. Or when the Achievement Unlocker is finished, you can automatically run the Automatic Idler.

You can chain tasks together to create a workflow that suits your needs.
