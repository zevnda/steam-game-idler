## Notifications

When new free games are detected, SGI will show a notification in the bottom-right corner of your screen. You can disable the [Free Game Notifications](/docs/settings/general#free-game-notifications) in the settings.

## What Counts as a Free Game?

SGI only considered a game to be free if it is temporarily available for `$0.00` as part of a promotion or sale on the Steam store.

This is different to free-to-play games, which have no price and are always available for free. Free-to-play games are not shown in the Free Games list.
